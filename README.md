# temporal-engineer-2
- A remake of a game jam gam that I helped develop
- Written in Go to see how easy it is to build without a game engine
- All artwork was made by Jack, not me!

> Original Game by [Jack Darlison](https://github.com/jackdarlison) and I: [Temporal Engineer](https://joshpattman.itch.io/temporal-engineer)
